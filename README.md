# OVO Energy Half-Hourly

This is an unsupported fork of an existing integration, see:
* https://github.com/home-assistant/core/tree/dev/homeassistant/components/ovo_energy
* https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ovo_energy

Complete credit to the initial development of this integration goes to @timmo001 - I just made a hacky modification to get half-hourly data.
